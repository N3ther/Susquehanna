# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
As there are currently no released versions, the current build will be supported. Anything else will not be. In the future, expect a time period of what is supported, most likely around 3-6 months.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.1   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to susquehanna-security@consus.fun. You should get a response within 3 days.
If you do not, send another email. Keep doing this until you get contact with me (N3ther). Alternatively, DM me on Discord, N3#0889.
In your report, please explain:
- What the vulnerability is
- How you found it
- What version is affected

There will not be a bug bounty program, as I do not have the funds for that.
