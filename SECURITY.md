## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to susquehanna-security@consus.fun. You should get a response within 3 days.
If you do not, send another email. Keep doing this until you get contact with me. Alternatively, DM me on Discord, n3.
In your report, please explain:
- What the vulnerability is
- How you found it
- What version is affected

There will not be a bug bounty program, as I do not have the funds for that.
