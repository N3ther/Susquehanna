	 *  Things needed to be stored in lexicon include:
	 *  Word
	 *  Meaning
	 *  IPA pronounciation
	 *  Etymology (perhaps a tree of how it's related to other words?)
	 *  Source language
	 *  Any potential grammatical classes
	 *  Creation date
	 *  Last edited date
	 *  Source?
	 *  Synonyms
	 *  Homonyms
	 *  Language it's for (this may seem redundant, however this should catch any errors if someone messes with the data files)
	 *  
	 *  Perhaps each word could be it's own file in the lexicon folder?
	 *  In reality I think the lexicon is just going to be a file list
